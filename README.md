# Customer churn analysis and prediction

📢 Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction | End-to-End Data Science Project

Excited to share a recent project where I addressed a key challenge in the telecom industry — understanding and predicting customer churn.

🔍 The Challenge:
Customer churn leads to significant revenue loss. Identifying at-risk customers early can help businesses take proactive measures to retain them.

💡 My Solution:
I designed a complete pipeline that blends data analytics, BI reporting, and machine learning to analyze churn behavior and predict future churners.

⚙️ Project Workflow:

📥 Data Collection – Sourced a telecom dataset from Kaggle

🧹 Data Preprocessing – Cleaned, encoded, and feature-engineered using Python

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis – Conducted using Matplotlib, Seaborn & Power BI

🌲 Model Building – Trained a Random Forest classifier to predict churn

📈 Dashboarding – Created interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize trends and prediction results

📌 Key Insights:

📉 Overall churn rate was 27%

👩 64% of churned customers were female

🔄 Month-to-month contracts had the highest churn

🌍 Jammu & Kashmir had the highest churn rate (~60%)

🧓 Senior citizens were more likely to leave

⚔️ Competition was the most common churn reason

📡 Churn was higher among customers without security or support services

🛠️ Tools Used:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, Power BI, Seaborn, Matplotlib

🔮 Looking Ahead:

Real-time churn detection

Personalized retention strategies

Integration with BI tools for deeper regional insights
